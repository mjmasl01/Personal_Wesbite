## Summary

I am a data scientist with experience in data processing, analytics, modeling, engineering, and implementation â€” including interactive dashboards. I hold a B.S. in Data Science from St. Lawrence University and recently completed my M.S. in Data Science at Boston University, where I focused on machine/deep learning, AI ethics & privacy, medical science, financial analytics, and big data engineering with Azure.

I bring hands-on experience developing machine learning pipelines, performing clinical research, and building data products in collaboration with health institutions, nonprofits, and academic teams. I'm especially passionate about applying technical rigor to high-impact, real-world domains.
