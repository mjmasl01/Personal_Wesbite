    "text": "Iâ€™m a data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modeling, machine learning, and cloud-based analytics. I earned a B.S. in Data Science from St.Â Lawrence University in May 2024, where I focused on applied statistics, advanced modeling, and database systems. I have recently completed my M.S. in Data Science at Boston University, with coursework in Bayesian statistics, deep learning, AI ethics, medical science, and financial analytics.\nMy work spans health analytics, finance, sports, and public data visualization. Highlights include:\n\nBuilding real-time Azure pipelines and sentiment models for cryptocurrency analytics\n\nCreating Shiny dashboards and Power BI visualizations for public health and sports data\n\nDeveloping predictive models for depression risk using the NHANES survey and clinical data\n\nContributing to a published clinical research article on hemodynamic monitoring in cardiac patients\n\nWhether regression modeling, cloud infrastructure, or storytelling through dashboards, I love applying data to solve real-world problems with clarity and insight.\nDocuments\nðŸ“„ View Cover Letter (PDF)\nðŸŽ“ View Resume (PDF)\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Alcohol Consumption Dashboard\nInteractive Shiny app visualizing historical trends in per capita alcohol consumption across U.S. states by beverage type.\nMarch Madness Analysis\nA Shiny dashboard analyzing NCAA March Madness performance, team statistics, and tournament insights.\nBitcoin Market & Sentiment Tracker\nReal-time Power BI dashboard combining social sentiment analysis and cryptocurrency price signals, powered by Azure-based data pipelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a Research Assistant (Summer 2023), I conducted statistical analysis in RStudio â€” including descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing â€” to examine systolic pressure variations across three arterial sites in cardiac surgery patients. This work contributed to a peer-reviewed research article published in the Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia.\nCitation:\nBui D, Hayward G, Chen TH, Apruzzese P, Asher S, Maslow M, Gorgone M, Hunter C, Flaherty D, Kendall M, Maslow A. Hemodynamic Monitoring in The Cardiac Surgical Patient: Comparison of Three Arterial Catheters. J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth. 2024 May;38(5):1115â€“1126. doi: 10.1053/j.jvca.2024.02.010. PMID: 38461034.\nView article\n\n\n\nDuring my Senior Year Experience (SYE) at St.Â Lawrence University, I developed a public-facing data analytics project published by the SCORE Network. The project analyzes rider and bull performance data from the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) tour, using scraped statistics and custom indicators to explore event structure, athlete outcomes, as well as creating educational material for new data science learners to use.\nView SCORE Network Project"
