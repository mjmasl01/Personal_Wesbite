Hi, I'm Matt — a data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modeling, machine learning, and cloud-based analytics. I earned a B.S. in Data Science from [St. Lawrence University](https://www.stlawu.edu/offices/math-computer-science-and-statistics){target="_blank"} in May 2024, where I focused on applied statistics, advanced modeling, and database systems. I’m currently completing my M.S. in Data Science at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/cds/), with coursework in Bayesian statistics, deep learning, AI ethics, medical science, and financial analytics.

My work spans health analytics, finance, sports, and public data visualization. Highlights include:
- Building real-time Azure pipelines and sentiment models for cryptocurrency analytics
- Creating Shiny dashboards and Power BI visualizations for public health and sports data
- Developing predictive models for depression risk using the NHANES survey and clinical data
- Contributing to a published clinical research article on hemodynamic monitoring in cardiac patients

Whether regression modeling, cloud infrastructure, or storytelling through dashboards, I love applying data to solve real-world problems with clarity and insight.

## Projects & Publications

**Publication**  
As a Research Assistant (Summer 2023), I conducted statistical analysis in RStudio — including descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing — to examine systolic pressure variations across three arterial sites in cardiac surgery patients. This work contributed to a peer-reviewed research article published in the *Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia*.

**Citation:**  
Bui D, Hayward G, Chen TH, Apruzzese P, Asher S, Maslow M, Gorgone M, Hunter C, Flaherty D, Kendall M, Maslow A. *Hemodynamic Monitoring in The Cardiac Surgical Patient: Comparison of Three Arterial Catheters.* J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth. 2024 May;38(5):1115–1126. doi: [10.1053/j.jvca.2024.02.010](https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2024.02.010).
