### Hi, I'm Matt

I'm a data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modeling, machine learning, and cloud-based analytics. I earned a B.S. in Data Science from [St. Lawrence University](https://www.stlawu.edu/offices/math-computer-science-and-statistics){target="_blank"} in May 2024, where I focused on applied statistics, advanced modeling, and database systems. I have recently completed my M.S. in Data Science at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/cds/), with coursework in Bayesian statistics, machine/deep learning, AI ethics & Privacy, medical science, financial analytics, and Big Data with Azure.

My work spans health analytics, finance, sports, and public survey data. Highlights include:

- Building real-time Azure pipelines and sentiment models for cryptocurrency analytics  
- Creating Shiny dashboards and Power BI visualizations for public health and sports data  
- Developing predictive models for depression risk using the NHANES survey and clinical data  
- Contributing to a published clinical research article on hemodynamic monitoring in cardiac patients  

Whether regression modeling, cloud infrastructure, or storytelling through dashboards, I love applying data to solve real-world problems with clarity and insight.
